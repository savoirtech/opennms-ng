What is OpenNMS-NG?
-------------------
OpenNMS-NG is a modular implementation of the [OpenNMS] monitoring stack based on
OSGi.  This was a proof of concept built to show how OpenNMS could be
converted to run in Karaf with ActiveMQ to make it highly distributed.

The work has been merged into opennms experimental branches and is continuing
to be worked on, but this tree is not actively maintained and will no longer
build with current versions of OpenNMS code.
